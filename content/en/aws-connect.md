AWS Accounts can be named and associated with teams.

You will need to provide IAM Security Credentials that will allow Fume to create an IAM role.  Details on creating these keys [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#Using_CreateAccessKey).

These credentials will __not__ be stored and can be deleted immediately after.
